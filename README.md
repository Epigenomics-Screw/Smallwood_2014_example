The authors describe a method of single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS-seq) accurately measuring DNA methylation at up to 48.4% of CpG sites in embryonic stem cells grown in different media. They propose that scBS-seq is a versatile tool for exploring DNA methylation in rare cells and heterogeneous populations, integrating 12 individual mouse oocyte datasets and showing that it largely recapitulates the whole DNA methylome.
